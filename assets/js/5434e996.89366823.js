The parts can contain any type of data; to keep track of the data type of each part without relying on file\r\nextensions, the type for each part is specified in a file within the package called [Content_Types].xml. The relationships of the parts to the package\r\nas well as relationships that any part may have are abstracted from the parts and stored separately in relationship files--one for the package as a whole\r\nand one for each package that has relationships.
